    <h2>Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!</h2>
    <p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is a two-player game where each player selects one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors.</p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to defeat your opponent by selecting a gesture that beats their gesture.</p>
    <p>Rock beats scissors, as rock crushes scissors, while scissors beats paper, as it cuts paper.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, paper beats rock, as it covers rock.</p>
    <p>If both players choose the same option, the result is a tie.</p>
    <p>To determine a winner in a single round, both players must make their choice, without knowing the other player's choice.</p>
    <p>Use the toolbar above to play the game!</p>
    <p>Good luck, and have fun ;)</p>
